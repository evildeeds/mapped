1 - Introduction
1.1 - Purpose of application
We have chosen to create a lecture hall finder, the idea is to make it easy
to find a location based on a name. Not just for older students but mostly for the new ones that never been to Chalmers before (Or any other University).
The design will be generalized as a precise location finder, possibly displaying individual rooms and how to find them with
additional information such as possible entrances, floor number and also a path from the current location. 


1.2 - General characteristics of application
The application is a collaboration of three parts: Map, Setting and Search.
The Map is a mapping over the area you are in and how you go from there. Settings changes how you view the map and small changes overall
and Search is what you want to show on your map

1.3 - Scope of application
Our App is limited to the schools, but since we will use the google maps service you will be able to get to our school(s) from anywhere.
We are not in any way associated with Google.

1.4 - Objectives and success criteria of the project
● Use of google maps service
● GPS for exact coordinates of the rooms
● Add building annotations
● Add Sample of rooms/buildings (Springa runt)

1.5 - Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations
Building Annotation: Draw on set map, showing entrance(s)

2 - Proposed application

2.1 - Overview
Frapp will show you what which building it is in, and the room you are looking for.

2.2 - Functional requirements
1 - Location-related Requirements

1.1 - View Search
Scenario: View search fields
Trigger: Starting the frapp
Precondition: Checks if copy&paste isn't a room/building name
Basic path
The user starts frapp, shows search fields for rooms and buildings.
1.2 - 
Scenario: View Map
Trigger: Starting the Frapp
Precondition: If you got a room/building name in the copy&paste memory
Basic path
Will go directly to map showing the room/building chosen by the copy memory.
1.3
Scenario: View map
Trigger: Swiping the map
Precondition: the map is active
Basic path
Moves from the map to the search field, with a right-to-left swipe
1.4
Scenario: View Search
Trigger: the search fields are correctly filled and you pressed the "go button"
Precondition: the search activity is active
Basic path
The user selects from the fields and goes to the map.
1.5
Scenario: View Search
Trigger: Swiping from left-to-right 
Precondition: Having a correctly active map or the search fields correct or copy&paste memory have a room/building name.
Basic path
Goes from search to map, if you made a mistake of going to the search and wants to go back to the map.
1.6
Scenario: View map
Trigger: Use two fingers pulling together/apart
Precondition: The map activity is active
Basic path
Zooms in or out depending how you move your fingers.

2 - Contribution-related Requirements
We leave this one blank because: If we fill in every room and building so the user 
just choose from a list, there is nothing for the user to contribute with.

3 - User related requirements
We leave this blank because: We got nothing user related.


2.3 Non-functional requirements


2.4 Test cases
To-be-covered-later!
