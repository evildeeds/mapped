1 - Introduction
1.1 - Purpose of application
We have chosen to create a lecture hall finder, the idea is to make it easy
to find a location based on a name. Not just for older students but mostly for the new ones that never been to Chalmers before (Or any other University).
The design will be generalized as a precise location finder, possibly displaying individual rooms and how to find them with
additional information such as possible entrances, floor number and also a path from the current location. 


1.2 - General characteristics of application
The application is a collaboration of three parts: Map, Setting and Search.
The Map is a mapping over the area you are in and how you go from there. Settings changes how you view the map and small changes overall
and Search is what you want to show on your map

1.3 - Scope of application
Our App is limited to the schools, but since we will use the google maps service you will be able to get to our school(s) from anywhere.
We are not in any way associated with Google.

1.4 - Objectives and success criteria of the project
● Use of google maps service
● GPS for exact coordinates of the rooms
● Add building annotations
● Add Sample of rooms/buildings (Springa runt)

1.5 - Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations
Building Annotation: Draw on set map, showing entrance(s)
