1 - Introduction
1.1 - Purpose of application
We have chosen to create a lecture hall finder, the idea is to make it easy to find a location based on a name. Not just for older students but mostly for the new ones that never been to Chalmers before (Or any other University). The design will be generalized as a precise location finder, possibly displaying individual rooms and how to find them with additional information such as possible entrances, floor number and also a path from the current location. 

1.2 - General characteristics of application
The application is a collaboration of three parts: Map, Setting and Search.
The Map is a mapping over the area you are in and how you go from there. Settings changes how you view the map and small changes overall and Search is what you want to show on your map

1.3 - Scope of application
Our App is limited to the schools, but since we will use the google maps service you will be able to get to our school(s) from anywhere. We are not in any way associated with Google.

1.4 - Objectives and success criteria of the project
● Use of google maps service
● GPS for exact coordinates of the rooms
● Add building annotations
● Add Sample of rooms/buildings (Springa runt)

1.5 - Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations
Building Annotation: Draw on set map, showing entrance(s)

2 - Proposed application

2.1 - Overview
Frapp will show you what which building it is in, and the room you are looking for.

2.2 - Functional requirements
2.2.1 Database-related requirements

2.2.1.1 - Load rooms
Scenario: Loading rooms from database
Trigger: Starting FRAPP
Precondition: Rooms cached.
Basic path
The user starts frapp

2.3 - Contribution-related requirements
We leave this one blank because: If we fill in every room and building so the user 
just choose from a list, there is little for the user to contribute with.

2.4 - User related requirements
2.4.1 - Location-related requirements

2.4.1.1 - View Search
Scenario: View search fields
Trigger: Starting FRAPP
Precondition: An input box for finding locations is displayed.
Basic path
The user starts frapp, shows a search field for rooms and buildings.
2.4.1.2 - View Map
Scenario: View Map
Trigger: Starting FRAPP
Precondition: The starting intent contains a valid location.
Basic path
Will go directly to map showing the room/building chosen location.
2.4.1.3 - View Map
Scenario: View Map
Trigger: Starting FRAPP
Precondition: The starting intent contains an invalid location.
Basic path
Will go directly to the search field filled with the provided location.
2.4.1.4 - View Map
Scenario: View map
Trigger: Swiping the map
Precondition: The map view is active
Basic path
Moves from the map to the search field, with a right-to-left swipe
2.4.1.5
Scenario: View Search
Trigger: The search fields are correctly filled and you pressed the "go button"
Precondition: The search activity is active
Basic path
The user selects from the fields and goes to the map.
2.4.1.6
Scenario: View Search
Trigger: Swiping from left-to-right 
Precondition: The search field is correctly filled.
Basic path
Goes from search to map, if you made a mistake of going to the search and wants to go back to the map.
2.4.1.7
Scenario: View Search
Trigger: Swiping from left-to-right 
Precondition: The search field is incorrectly filled.
Basic path
Nothing happens.
2.4.1.8
Scenario: View map
Trigger: Use two fingers pulling together/apart
Precondition: The map activity is active
Basic path
Zooms in or out depending how you move your fingers.


2.5 Non-functional requirements
2.5.1 FRAPP shall be selectable as a location finder on Android.
2.5.2 The database shall be XML-based.

3 Test cases

3.1 Find location
Test case description: Test that Android lists FRAPP as a location finder.
Precondtion: Application not started.
Test steps:
 - Start an application which utilizes intents for finding a location.
 - Select a location.
 - Select FRAPP.
 - Observe FRAPP start and attemp to find the choosen location.
Related requirement: 2.4.1.2, 2.4.1.3, 2.5.1

3.2 Find location
Test case description: Test that choosing a valid location results in the map view getting displayed.
Precondtion: Application started.
Test steps:
 - Enter or choose a valid location.
 - Proceed to the map view.
 - Observe that the correct location is displayed.
