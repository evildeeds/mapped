Chosen project and description 
------------------------------
We have chosen to create a lecture hall finder, the idea is to make it easy
to find a location based on a name. The design will be generalized as a precise
location finder, possibly displaying individual rooms and how to find them with
additional information such as possible entrances, floor number and also a path
from the current location.

License
-------
Since we intend to use Google map services which require according to their tos
(https://developers.google.com/maps/terms) (ยง9.1) that our service must be
freely and publicly accessible to end users. Therefore we choose the Apache 2.0
license because its open and finally it is the liccense recommended for
Android. See (http://source.android.com/source/licenses.html).  

Features
--------
 * Displaying a very precise location, possibly a single room.
