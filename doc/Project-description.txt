Chosen project and description 
------------------------------
We have chosen to create a lecture hall finder, the idea is to make it easy
to find a location based on a name. The design will be generalized as a precise
location finder, possibly displaying individual rooms and how to find them with
additional information such as possible entrances, floor number and also a path
from the current location.
