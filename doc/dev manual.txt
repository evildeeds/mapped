Using FRAPP is easy after installing FRAPP on your android device, simply start FRAPP using the application launcher and enter a location name.

While entering a name FRAPP will display all location matching the selected category, known locations which matches the currently entered. The empty category matches all locations, location names are formatted by pre-appending the building name onto the local location name. When an entered string matches a known location you will immediately be taken to the map view where both your current GPS location and your destination is displayed.

From the map view it is possible to both zoom and pan to towards both your location and destination. After obtaining a suitable view of the destination you may now begin your journey.
