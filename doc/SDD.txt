2 - Proposed system architecture
	2.1 - Overview
	The android client will show annotations on the map according to the name from our XML. 
	It get the coordinates from the, parser to the database, then find the relevant information from the database
	2.2 - Software decomposition
	2.2.1 - General
	We have two activities and a module with parsing and a XML database
